### What I learned

During this project, I learned several key concepts that enhanced my understanding of frontend development:

1. **Responsive Design**: I implemented media queries to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. For example:
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
     .container {
        flex-direction: column;
     }
  }
  ```

2. **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: I utilized CSS Grid for the overall layout and Flexbox for aligning items within components. This combination allowed for a more flexible and organized structure:
  ```css
  .grid-container {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }

Also, I learned the importance of semantic HTML and accessibility, ensuring that my project is usable for everyone.

Reflecting on these learnings has solidified my knowledge and prepared me for future projects.
